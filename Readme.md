# Pygments lexer for pseudocode

This is a simple pygments lexer for pseudocode, there are a few out there but I wanted one specific for our class course Algorithms and Data Structures 2 so I created my own.

To use you can install directly from the GitHub repository using PIP:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cprieto/pygments-pseudocode.git
```

And use it as any other lexer, the registered types are algo, pseudocode
